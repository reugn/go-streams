A lightweight stream processing library for Go.  
`go-streams` provides a simple and concise DSL to build data pipelines.

> [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing))  
> In computing, a pipeline, also known as a data pipeline, is a set of data processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one. The elements of a pipeline are often executed in parallel or in time-sliced fashion. Some amount of buffer storage is often inserted between elements.

## Overview
Building blocks:
* Source - A Source is a set of stream processing steps that has one open output.
* Flow - A Flow is a set of stream processing steps that has one open input and one open output. 
* Sink - A Sink is a set of stream processing steps that has one open input. Can be used as a Subscriber.
